# Automate-the-Boring-Stuff
My attempts at the projects in Automate the Boring Stuff.

## Description
These are my attempts at the projects in Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart, from when I first began learning Python.  These worked at the time of adding them on to my GitHub, however please let me know if you find any issues.  Obviously, you should trying doing these yourself before looking up any answers, but don't punish yourself if you are struggling for hours on end!
I have missed one or two of the projects, mainly because they were made slightly tricky from the internet thinking I was a bot, but there are plenty of other implementations to be found online.
Anyway, I would really recommend this book!  Really does show just how powerful programming languages can be straight off the bat.
